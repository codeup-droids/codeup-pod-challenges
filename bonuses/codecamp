** Basic JavaScript **


- Escape Sequences in Strings -

Assign the following three lines of text into the single
variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

SOLUTION:
var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";


- Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator -

Build myStr from the strings "This is the start.
" and "This is the end." using the + operator.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

SOLUTION:
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";


- Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator -

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
"This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence."
using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown
in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on
the second string.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

SOLUTION:
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";


- Constructing Strings with Variables -

Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with
myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

SOLUTION:
var myName = "Edwin";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";


- Appending Variables to Strings -

Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

SOLUTION:
